# Learning Figma!

## Keyboard navigation and shortcuts, a training exercise!

Please, from the HupPup logo that's selected with no UI showing, how do we open the UI and navigate to the layers pane, navigate to the colors component group, group, rearrange, and rename if need be, and end up with the whole screen fit to view, no UI?

### Showing and Hiding the UI!

Command + either \ or . will get you there. I'm probably going to go with . as I'm still committing to memory that command + , gives you preferences, and it's right there.

### Getting to the Layers Pane!

Hit me like a brick that I didn't know this and how close I was to it. I know like, command + 1, command + 2, that'll give you the first or second tab, etc, and apperantly, hold on ... yea, command + 0 gets you to the project explorer in VSCode, which I also didn't know for a while, like way too long, and now I never need to use the mouse again?

Anyway, option + 1 and option + 2 are layers and assets, and option + 8, 9, and 0 are design, prototype, and inspect. So close, and how many times have I moused over? HOW MANY TIMES?

Oh, jeez, and here's a curveball for you, just hit tab. That's all you have to do, just hit tab. Oof.

### Navigating Layers!

To go to the next/prev sibling layer it's tab/shift + tab. To expand a parent layer, hit enter with it selected. Tabbing from there navigates through its children. To go up, hit shift + tab. To _collapse_ that parent layer's tree, it and all it's children must be selected which they are after shift + enter, then hit option + l, and that collapses them.

### Selecting Multiple Layers!

Turns out not super possible from the layers tab using the keyboard! Instead we can reach for the marquis tool (oh so fancy!) and hold command while dragging to deep select (select is click on _black_ canvas and drag, and all these components are on artboards, so ...) or shift + clicking to select a sequence in the layers tab.

### Other Exciting Things!

Now I know at least one of the reasons to never use the circle tool in figma and always use the rectabgle tool with a 50% border radius : the ... wait did I not understand "in relation to parent" again? Argg, train brain, gtg.
